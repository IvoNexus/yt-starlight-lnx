Show them love by supporting their projects! Keep up the good work guys!

## :computer: Dev Notes
Let's start with the most obvious question - why starlight, because it's my light at the end of the road. I'm a music freak, I love music, I love to discover new artists and can't live without music. There are two main reasons why I created [Starlight](https://github.com/IvoNexus/youtube-starlight), I travel to remote areas where internet it's not available at all time, I know most streaming platforms provide an option for offline use well, yes and no, because some of them need verification from time to time, so I decided to take control in my hands. The second reason, most of the artists I listen are not that popular and are all over the place, put the subscription plans aside, I don't want to use 5 different platforms/applications to do the same thing, so here we are - I unify it.

**Thank you for taking the time to read! Enjoy!**
